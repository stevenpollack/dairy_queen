# dairy_queen

This repository contains python code to calculate all possible "double dips" for
a specified set of show times, according to specified parameters.

A double dip (really, an _n_ dip) is just a fancy (non-technical) term to mean
a sequence of movies. You may know this by another term, but if you've ever
gone to the movies and seen two films in sequence, you've double dipped.

Now, extend this to _n_ films, back-to-back, and you've just completed an
n-dip...

# Usage
While you _could_ clone this repo and run the app locally (or mess with the contents of `dairy_queen/`),
this app is currently being hosted at [dairy-queen.herokuapp.com](https://dairy-queen.herokuapp.com/).

Also, you can always play with the [jupyter-notebook](demo.ipynb) if you want a demo on how you
can use the API programmatically.
